C Program to Compute pi
From Ryan Dahl's "Favorite Math Proofs"

By picking points randomly from a square one can calculuate
pi. Keep track of how many points from the square you pick
lay in the inscribed circle. Supposing the squareâ€™s edges are
length 2, then the inscribed circle has radius 1. Thus the area
of the circle is pi*r^2 = pi. The area of the square is 4. The ratio
of points picked from the circle to the total number of picked
points will converge to pi/4.
This is a C program to demonstrate the convergence.

			printf("%f\n", 4.0 * inside / total);
